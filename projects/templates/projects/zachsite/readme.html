          ZachSite is my first website.  I intend it as a place for me to
          showcase personal code projects, especially web applications.
          It's kind of a barebones layout, but I wanted to get experience
          with database driven web development and certain 
          frameworks/toolsets that I plan to use in the future, so under the
          hood it is maybe a little more robust than it needs to be.  This
          page is just me bragging about all those goodies with which I now 
          have some modest experience. So, if that interests you, read on.

              <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>,

          Django is really the key framework of the project, and learning
          how to use it effectively and properly has been my main focus
          through the whole development process. Also, I think databases 
          are neat, so I have tried to make the site as database driven as 
          possible.  For example, the documentation pages for my non-web 
          project(s) 
          (see <a href="{% url 'project_docs' '1' 'AudioIO' %}">AudioIO</a>)
          are composed almost entirely dynamically from the database so
          that I can easily edit a class description or method signature
          without having to go into the HTML.
          Unit testing is performed with Django's 
          <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/tools/">
            extension
          </a> of the Python standard library unittest module.

          UX design is not my primary interest. Take it at face value. 
          However, I have enjoyed getting my hands dirty with some of the 
          CSS and Javascript.  I've used Bootstrap as the real workhorse,
          but I've tried to customize the look and feel in ways that I
          think create value.  I don't know, you tell me....  UI level
          testing so far has been manual, with thorough testing on latest 
          OSX and iOS Safari, and smoke testing on OSX FireFox.

          I think server side programming is terrific. I very much like 
          problems that involve storing, manipulating, and wiring 
          large amounts of data, and in particular I am interested in signal 
          data that reflects a physical reality--whether that be a time-varying
          signal like audio, or a spatial one like LIDAR.  So, now that I 
          have some experience with a simple full web stack, I am planning on
          putting those skills to work building some kind of novelty GIS web 
          app, which is something Iâ€™ve wanted to do for a while.
          Wish me luck :)
