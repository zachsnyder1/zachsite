      Welcome to the AudioIO docs page!  The documentation below is not
      comprehensive, but it completely covers the user API, as well as certain
      other elements of the software that may help to illuminate the 
      underlying design patterns upon which it is built.  If you are looking 
      for a thorough treatment of all internal elements, inline documentation
      is provided in the form of 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring#Python">docstrings</a>.

    <h3>File Structure</h3>
    <p>Here's a fuzzy picture of what the package looks like:</p>
    <div class="pre-container">
      <pre>

  |- README.md                      -->  The README file for GitHub
  |--> audioIO/                     -->  Where the source files live
  |       |
  |       |--> io/                  -->  Holds modules that deal with I/O

    <p>Some things to notice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          At the highest level, the package is split into the audioIO/
          directory, which holds the main package contents, and the 
          testAudioIO/ directory, which holds all test automation 
          infrastructure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Within the audioIO/ directory, the source files are split based
          on whether they deal with I/O (the 'io/' dir) or the core plugin
          framework (the 'plugin/' dir).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The audioIO.py module in the io/ dir holds abstract base classes
          that define a common interface for audio file I/O in the context 
          of this framework.  This interface is then implemented separately 
          (in child classes) for each audio file format that is supported.  
          For example, the wavIO.py module holds concrete classes that 
          implement the interface for .WAV files.  See the 
          <a href="#design-overview">design overview</a> for more 
          information on this and other design patterns that are exploited.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The plugin.py module in the plugin/ dir defines the Plugin class, 
          which is what ties together and coordinates the functionality of
          the I/O classes.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
